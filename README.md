### notation
This project involves the use of Session as well as CORS, the front-end needs to run to http://localhost:3000 and the back-end needs to run to http://localhost:3001. This is something that must be met, otherwise there may be issues with cross-domain as well as COOKIES not being transferred correctly.
### For the contribution
The front-end code and specific COMMITS can be viewed by switching to the branch frontend, and the back-end code and specific COMMITS can be viewed by switching to the branch backend.
